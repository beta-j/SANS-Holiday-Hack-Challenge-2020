## PROCEDURE : ##

I copied the part of the billboard with the swirled text and pasted into [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/)

Then, I used the **‘Warp Transform’** tool with the following settings:
```
•	Transform: Swirl Clockwise
•	Size: 528px
•	Hardness: 50
•	Strength: 50
•	Spacing: 20
```

I applied the tool until the writing was just about legible enough:
