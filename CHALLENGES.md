# CHALLENGE 1 - Linux Primer #

## PROCEDURE : ##

>1.	Perform a directory listing of your home directory to find a munchkin and retrieve a lollipop!
```
$ ls
```

>2.	Now find the munchkin inside the munchkin.
```
$ cat munchkin_19315479765589239
```

>3.	Great, now remove the munchkin in your home directory.
```
$ rm munchkin_19315479765589239
```

>4.	Print the present working directory using a command.
```
$ pwd
```

>5.	Good job but it looks like another munchkin hid itself in you home directory. Find the hidden munchkin!
```
$ ls ‚Äìa
```

>6.	Excellent, now find the munchkin in your command history.
```
$ history
```

>7.	Find the munchkin in your environment variables.
```
$ env
```

>8.	Next, head into the workshop.
```
$ cd workshop/
```

>9.	A munchkin is hiding in one of the workshop toolboxes. Use "grep" while ignoring case to find which toolbox the munchkin is in.
```
$ cat toolbox_* | grep -i munchkin
```

>10.	A munchkin is blocking the lollipop_engine from starting. Run the lollipop_engine binary to retrieve this munchkin.
```
$ chmod 755 lollipop_engine
$ ./lollipop_engine
```

>11.	Munchkins have blown the fuses in /home/elf/workshop/electrical. cd into electrical and rename blown_fuse0 to fuse0.
```
$ cd /home/elf/workshop/electrical/
$ cp blown_fuse0 fuse0
$ rm blown_fuse0
```

>12.	Now, make a symbolic link (symlink) named fuse1 that points to fuse0
```
$ ln -s fuse0 fuse1
```

>13.	Make a copy of fuse1 named fuse2.
```
$ cp fuse1 fuse2
```

>14.	We need to make sure munchkins don't come back. Add the characters "MUNCHKIN_REPELLENT" into the file fuse2.
```
$ echo MUNCHKIN_REPELLENT >> fuse2
```

>15.	Find the munchkin somewhere in /opt/munchkin_den.
```
$ cd /opt/munchkin_den/
$ find -iname *munchkin*
```

>16.	Find the file somewhere in /opt/munchkin_den that is owned by the user munchkin.
```
$ find /opt/munchkin_den/ -user munchkin
```

>17.	Find the file created by munchkins that is greater than 108 kilobytes and less than 110 kilobytes located somewhere in /opt/munchkin_den.
```
$ find /opt/munchkin_den/ -size +108k -size -110k
```

>18.	List running processes to find another munchkin.
```
$ ps ‚Äìe
```

>19.	The 14516_munchkin process is listening on a tcp port. Use a command to have the only listening port display to the screen.
```
$ netstat ‚Äìnapt
```

>20.	The service listening on port 54321 is an HTTP server. Interact with this server to retrieve the last munchkin.
```
$ curl 0.0.0.0:54321
```

>21.	Your final task is to stop the 14516_munchkin process to collect the remaining lollipops.
```
$ kill 28786
```

>22.	Congratulations, you caught all the munchkins and retrieved all the lollipops!
>	Type "exit" to close...
```
$ exit
```

>-	**SHINNY UPATREE:** There's probably some kind of [command injection](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Command_Injection) vulnerability in the menu terminal.
</details>

  
## PROCEDURE : ##
The hint pretty much points us in the right direction immediatley and the link within it explicity explains what needs to be done.

When prompted I selected menu item **4. Print Name Badge** which accepts free text input and kindly asks you to avoid special characters as *‚Äúthey cause some weird errors‚Äù*.  I disobeyed this and entered ``;/bin/bash`` and that got me to a bash prompt.

# CHALLENGE 6 - Speaker Door Open #

## HINTS: ##

  <summary>Hints provided for Challenge 6</summary>
  
>-	**BUSHY EVERGREEN:**  The `strings` command is common in Linux and available in Windows as part of `SysInternals`.

</details>

  
## PROCEDURE : ##
Run `strings door` ‚Äì this returns clear text from within the binary file

I notice this part:

Well that‚Äôs a convenient reminder ``And don‚Äôt forget, the password is`` **``‚ÄúOp3nTheD00r‚Äù``**

# CHALLENGE 7 - Speaker Lights On #

## HINTS: ##
<details>
  <summary>Hints provided for Challenge 7</summary>
  
>-	**BUSHY EVERGREEN:**  While you have to use the lights program in `/home/elf/` to turn the lights on, you can delete parts in `/home/elf/lab/`.

</details>

  
## PROCEDURE : ##
Bushy Evergreen hints us immediately in the right direction ‚Äì what if we were to replace the username in the `lights.conf` file with an encrypted value?  So I edited `lab/lights.conf` and replaced the username with the encypted password string.  When I ran `./lights` in `lab/` it conveniently unencrypted the string in the username for me üòÑ
![image](https://github.com/beta-j/SANS-Holiday-Hack-Challenge-2020/assets/60655500/49b722d5-2f68-47fc-9a0b-b6776ab0a07d)

Then I just passed on the same password to `/home/elf/lights`.

# CHALLENGE 8 - Vending Machine #

## HINTS: ##
<details>
  <summary>Hints provided for Challenge 8</summary>
  
>-	**BUSHY EVERGREEN:**  For polyalphabetic ciphers, if you have control over inputs and visibilty of outputs, lookup tables can save the day.

</details>

  
## PROCEDURE : ##
I decided to follow Bushy Evergreen‚Äôs hint to the letter and deleted the `lab/vending_machine.json` file, ran `./vending_machine` and entered `AAAAAAAAAAA` and `BBBBBBBBBB` as username and password.

Looking at the resulting `vending_machine.json` file and knowing (from the hints) that this was a polyalphabetic cipher, I could immediately tell that the password was being encoded with a 8-character repeating key.

Varying the username whilst keeping the same password had no effect on the encoded output, so the key being used must be a static one.

So I created [an Excel sheet](assets/vending%20machine%20challenge.xlsx) and plotted out the results for each combination of `AAAAAAAAA`, `BBBBBBBB`, `CCCCCC`, etc...  including lowercase letters and numbers.  I knew that the enciphered password is **`LVEdQPpBwr`** ‚Äì so if any of the abve combinations gave me a corresponding letter in the correct position as the enciphered text (eg. `E` in the 3rd position or `r` in the 10th position), then I could tell that the repeating letter used as my input is the corresponding letter of the cleartext password.

![image](https://github.com/beta-j/SANS-Holiday-Hack-Challenge-2020/assets/60655500/bfe4b5c9-8812-41f8-bc3e-aca311cd78d8)

As per Bushy‚Äôs advice I set up a lookup table in excel to match corresponding entries and show the correct password characters:
```
=INDEX($A$2:$A$63,MATCH(TRUE,EXACT(S2,B2:B63),0))
```
I ran the `vending_machine` program over and over again using the most commonly used characters first and after a while I had my deciphered password: **`CandyCane1`**.

I‚Äôm not particularly proud of how I solved this one, but hey ‚Äì it did the trick.

Maybe [the typeof operator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/typeof) could also be useful?
